## Work In Progress


**emmagold** is a forkable, scalable solution for independent prisoner support pages. It's a Jekyll site usable in Github Pages, with the inclusion of a Coinhive monero miner. This allows users to passively donate their computing resources in the form of Monero, an untraceable cryptocurrency. This pool of Monero can then be applied to legal funds, gifts behind bars, and re-integration after release. :fist:

To make your own prisoner support page, fork or clone this repository. Then, replace the relevant material in these files:

* /_config.yml
* /favicon.ico
* /about.md
* /assets/images/profile.jpg
* /includes/js-miner.html

To get a Coinhive Site Key for js-miner.html, go to [the Coinhive website](https://coinhive.com)

*Note: donations made using the **Free Emma Goldman!** page will support the producers of this software. Emma is already out of prison and, to be honest, quite beyond our help at this point.* :moneybag:
