Casey Brezik, an accused anarchist assassin from the Kansas City area who is charged with slashing the throat of the Dean of Metropolitan Community College-Penn Valley in a plot to attack the Governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon during a talk at the college. (Nixon later canceled.) Casey is currently being held by the state of Missouri for 12 years on each of three counts – assault, and two armed criminal action charges – and seven years on a second count of assault. All sentences will run concurrently.

Casey has resided in a few different places during his incarceration. Currently he’s at the Northeast Correctional Center (NCC) in Bowling Green, Missouri, but is expecting to be transferred soon.

He recently got married to a woman being held in another Missouri prison. He’s studying calculus so he can go to school to be an aerospace engineer once he’s released. He goes before the parole board November 2018. He’s unsure of exactly when he gets out, but knows he isn’t eligible until November 2020. He’s currently saving his money (and asking for help) to afford a cheap vehicle when he gets out in order to transport himself to work and school.  His intentions are to parole out to the St. Louis area and attending a community college until he gets his basic credits and can transfer to a university. His eyes are set on the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Casey suffers from depression and has a history of schizophrenia. he describes himself as socially awkward and says he often feels misunderstood. He has a kind heart and regrets having inadvertently hurt some of those who have tried to reach out to him while doing his time. He hopes you can forgive him. He looks forward to getting out relatively soon and getting to see all of those who have shown him support over the years. He thanks you all.
